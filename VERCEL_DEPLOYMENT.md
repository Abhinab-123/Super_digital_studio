# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Super Digital Editorial & Wedding Agency application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- Environment variables ready (see `.env.example`)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to your Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Import Project to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your repository from the list
4. Vercel will auto-detect the project settings

### 3. Configure Build Settings

Vercel should auto-detect these settings, but verify:

- **Framework Preset**: Other (or None)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

In the Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables:

1. **DATABASE_URL**
   - Your PostgreSQL database connection string
   - Format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
   - For Neon DB (recommended): Get from your Neon dashboard

2. **Cloudinary Integration** (for gallery images):
   - **CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME**: Your Cloudinary cloud name (from dashboard)
   - **CLOUDINARY_API_KEY**: Your Cloudinary API key
   - **CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET**: Your Cloudinary API secret
   
   Get these from: [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console)

3. **NODE_ENV**
   - Set to: `production`

### 5. Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 1-3 minutes)
3. Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

## Database Setup

### Using Neon (Recommended for Vercel)

1. Create a free account at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the connection string
4. Add it as `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
5. Push your database schema:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

### Alternative: Supabase or PlanetScale

Both work well with Vercel and offer free tiers.

## Cloudinary Setup for Vercel

Your gallery images are managed through Cloudinary:

1. **Create/Login to Cloudinary Account**
   - Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
   - Sign up or log in to your account

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - From your Cloudinary Dashboard
   - Copy: Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret

3. **Upload Images**
   - Navigate to Media Library
   - Create a folder named "studio"
   - Upload your portfolio images to this folder

4. **Add to Vercel**
   - In Vercel dashboard â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add all three Cloudinary credentials
   - Redeploy if already deployed

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
- Verify `package.json` has correct build scripts

### API Routes Not Working

- Ensure API routes are in `/api` directory
- Check that `vercel.json` has correct rewrites
- Verify environment variables are set

### Database Connection Issues

- Double-check `DATABASE_URL` format
- Ensure database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges
- For Neon/Supabase, enable connection pooling

### 404 Errors on Page Refresh

- This is handled by `vercel.json` rewrites
- If issues persist, check `vercel.json` configuration

## Post-Deployment

1. Test all functionality:
   - Homepage loads correctly
   - API endpoints respond
   - Database operations work
   - Cloudinary gallery images load correctly

2. Set up custom domain (optional):
   - Go to project settings in Vercel
   - Click "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update DNS records as instructed

3. Enable automatic deployments:
   - Vercel automatically deploys on every git push to main branch
   - Configure preview deployments for pull requests

## Monitoring

Vercel provides built-in monitoring:

- **Analytics**: View page views and user metrics
- **Logs**: Check function logs for errors
- **Speed Insights**: Monitor performance

Access these from your Vercel dashboard.

## Cost Considerations

Vercel Free Tier includes:
- Unlimited deployments
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Serverless function executions
- SSL certificates

For production apps with high traffic, consider upgrading to Pro.
