## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Core Technology Stack:**
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** as the build tool and development server for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and API integration
- **Framer Motion** for fluid animations and transitions

**UI Component System:**
- **shadcn/ui** component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** for managing component variants
- **Custom design system** following luxury editorial guidelines with specific color palette (Deep Charcoal, Warm Gold, Soft Cream)

**Component Architecture:**
The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation:
- Page components (`client/src/pages/`) - Route-level containers
- Feature components (`client/src/components/`) - Business logic components (Hero, Gallery, Services, Team, Contact, etc.)
- UI components (`client/src/components/ui/`) - Reusable design system primitives
- Layout components (Navigation, Footer) for consistent structure

**State Management Strategy:**
- React Context for global UI state (sidebar, toast notifications)
- TanStack Query for server state with custom query functions
- Local component state using React hooks for UI interactions

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **Node.js** runtime with ES modules support
- Custom Vite middleware integration for development

**Development vs Production:**
- Development: Vite dev server with HMR proxied through Express
- Production: Static assets served from compiled build directory
- Dual build process: Vite for client bundle, esbuild for server bundle

**Database Layer:**
- **Drizzle ORM** configured for PostgreSQL with type-safe schema definitions
- **Neon Database** (@neondatabase/serverless) as the PostgreSQL provider
- Schema-first approach with Zod validation integration
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) for development/fallback

**Storage Abstraction:**
The application uses an interface-based storage pattern (`IStorage`) allowing swappable implementations:
- Current: In-memory Map-based storage
- Designed for: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- Supports user CRUD operations with UUID-based identifiers

### Design System

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Primary: Playfair Display (serif) for headlines and luxury branding
- Secondary: Inter/DM Sans (sans-serif) for body text and UI elements
- Structured scale: 4xl-6xl for heroes, 3xl-4xl for sections, base-lg for body

**Color System:**
Implemented through CSS custom properties with HSL values:
- Primary: Warm Gold accent (45째 85% 60%)
- Background: Pure white with soft cream cards (45째 25% 98%)
- Foreground: Deep Charcoal text (220째 15% 15%)
- Supporting: Muted Rose for bridal elements (350째 20% 85%)

**Responsive Layout:**
- Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-based grid systems
- 12-column desktop, 4-column tablet, 2-column mobile
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's 4/8/16/24 unit scale
- Max-width container (7xl) with generous horizontal padding
